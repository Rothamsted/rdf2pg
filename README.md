# The rdf2pg Framework

rdf2pg is a framework to convert from RDF data to [labelled property graphs][10] (PG), aiming 
at supporting custom mapping from RDF data models to any target PG format or graph database.

At the moment, we have a tool to convert RDF to Neo4j data, and one to produce graphml files.
